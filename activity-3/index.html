            As a Mitsubishi owner, I know that garage work is routinely needed to keep an owner's Mitsubishi in top condition.<br>
            Time and time again, whenever parts are needed for my Mitsubishi, I always turn to MAPerformance to find deals on parts.<br><br>
            Below are my reviews of parts I've purchased from MAPerformance.
        </p>

        <h2>My Product Reviews</h2>

            <h3>OEM DiaQueen SST Transmission Fluid</h3>
            <img class="review-image" src="images/sstfluid.jpg" alt="OEM Diaqueen SST Transmission Fluid">
            <p>I purchased two 4 Liter jugs of OEM Diaqueen SST Transmission Fluid <br>
                from MAPerformane. Since doing a transmission fluid change with <br>the oem
                fluid, my car has been shifting like new!

            <h3>OEM Mitsubishi Timing Chain | Updated Chain</h3>
            <img class="review-image" src="images/chain.jpg" alt="OEM Mitsubishi Timing Chain">
            <p>My Ralliart had the old type of timing chain in it and had been running<br> for about 130k miles.
                Right at the 130k mark though, my dash gave me the <br>triangle of death
                (Red triangle with '!' in it) which meant the car was reading that <br>
                the timing was off and there's a stretch in the timing chain. I'm SURE the chain was<br>
                stretched well before the light began to appear. I was able to get the timing chain and <br> 
                all the parts I needed for the replacement (tensioners, guides, oil filter) all here on MAPerformance<br>
                and now my engine is running smooth! (When the old chain was removed there was about almost an<br>
                inch in slack so i'm very glad I was able to get such a high quality oem part on MAPerformance!

            <h3>Evo X MAP Exhaust Manifold</h3>
            <img class="review-image" src="images/manifold.jpg" alt="Evo X MAPerformance Exhaust Manifold">
            <p>An exhaust manifold was a must have for me after I acquired a Evo X 4B11T Turbo.<br>
                This exhaust manifold runs as great as it looks and gives the much needed air flow<br>
                to my car's turbo. Also to mention, it gives better response times out of the Turbo.
